# py-sysinfo

> Author: Brian Tomlinson <darthlukan@gmail.com>


## Description

> py-sysinfo is my Python script [sysinfo](https://github.com/darthlukan/sysinfo) in Snap form. The only difference
> is that instead of calling ```$ ./sysinfo.py``` you call ```$ py-sysinfo```.


## Installation

> The easiest way to install py-sysinfo is via the snap tool:

```
$ snap install py-sysinfo
```


## Hacking

> If you'd prefer to hack around with the snapcraft.yml:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:darthlukan/py-sysinfo.git
$ cd py-sysinfo
$ $EDITOR snap/snapcraft.yml
(( Make your changes ))
$ snapcraft
```

> From there, you'll have built the actual snap package and can head over to [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/)
> to learn about what you can do with the snapcraft tool.
